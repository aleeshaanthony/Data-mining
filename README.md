In this experimental study, Decision Trees classifiers and Naive Bayes classifiers were developed and compared in their accuracy of predicting the risk level of heart disease. For prediction, the algorithm considers fourteen
medical characteristics, including blood pressure, cholesterol, age, sex, and obesity. The model forecasts a patient's risk of developing heart disease. It makes substantial knowledge possible.
For instance, links between patterns and medical characteristics linked to heart disease are yet to be determined.
